# BigBrother  

## 0.Is this project running ?
Sadly, nope.  
The owner of this repo is lazy, but this project will be kept updating.  
The owner is still working on functions of this project, and a executable version of BigBrother will be made ASAP.
## 1.What is BigBrother ?
Project BigBrother is a file monitoring tool for AWD.  

## 2.How does it work ?
By caculating the MD5 sum, the BigBrother is watching changes of all files in the monitored folder. When the BigBrother found a unauthorized changed file, the change will be reported and discarded.  

## 3.TODO
In future commits, the BigBrother will be able to allow the user to change their file and pause the BigBrother itself.
